      The 'alt' tag is what is displayed if the img can't be found

      'a' tags allow you to reference other html pages
      Note that in the example below we just pass a filename and
      not a full filepath. This is because the two html files
      are in the same directory.

      Note that the text in between the 'a' tags is what shows up
      as the hyperlink text
