<!--
  Divs and spans allow you create groupings of data on your page
  One of the main reasons you'd want to do this is so that you can
  then style those sections of code using CSS.

  Also helps add some organization to the page.

    <h1>Divs and Spans</h1>
    <!--
      Divs allow you to tag together groups of elements into generic containers
      -->
    <div class="groupone">

      <h1>Group One</h1>
      <p>I want to be together in group one</p>

    </div>

    <!--
      Spans are similar to divs, except it's inline
      So rather than grabbing an entire container, it just grabs a line
      Or portion of a line

      In the example below, there is a span inside a div.
      -->
    <div class="groupone">

      <h1>Group One</h1>
      <p>I want to <span>be together in</span> group one</p>

    </div>
