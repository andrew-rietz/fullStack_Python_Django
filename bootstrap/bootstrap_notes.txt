Bootstrap is a very common framework for front-end development

Frameworks:
- Inversion of control. The framework defines rules for you to follow
- Default behavior
- Extensibility
- Non-modifiable framework code


A large part of bootstrap is knowing how to reference the
documentation for your own use cases


New items introduced in Bootstrap v4:

- Panels are replaced by cards
- Larger default font sizes
- New grid tier (XL)
- Use of flexbox
- Moved from Less to Sass (CSS frameworks)


The most important thing is to get the ability to reference and work
with the bootstrap documentation.


There are two ways to use bootstrap:
[1] Download the framework
[2] Use the CDN (Content Delivery Network)

We're going to use the CDN for this course.
