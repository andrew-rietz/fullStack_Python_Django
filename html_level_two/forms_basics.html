    <h1>Forms Basics</h1>

    <!-- By default, forms have three option attributes:
          - class:  
          - action:
          - method:
          We're going to gloss over for now, but will be used later on
    -->
    <form>
      <h2>Log In</h2>
      <h3>Please input your Email and Password</h3>

      <!--
        To take in user input, you need to create an <input> tag
        By default, this tag has two attributes:
        - type:   The type of input we're asking for
        - name:   Name is what you want to call the input so it can be referenced later
        - value:  Default value in case user doesn't enter anything
      -->
      <input type="email" name="userEmail" value="Email">
      <input type="password" name="userPassword" value="">
      <!--
        In order to allow the user to submit the input, you need to create
        a "submit" input
      -->
      <input type="submit" name="" value="Click here to submit">

    </form>
