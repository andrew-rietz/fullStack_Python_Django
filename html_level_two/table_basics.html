      HTML tables have the general structure:
      <table>  Indicates that there is going to be a table
        <thead>  This is the header row
          <th> These are the cells in the header row
        <tr> These are the table rows (non-header)
          <td> These are the cells within each row
    -->
    <!-- You can add a border using an optional 'border' tag -->
    <table border="1">
      <!--
        If you were to remove the thead section, you'd still get a table
        Items in the th tag are bolded
        The TH section helps the reader by defining the different columns
      -->
      <thead>
        <th>Number</th>
        <th>Color</th>
        <th>Country</th>
